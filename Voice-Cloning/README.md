# Real-Time Voice Cloning

Files:

- voice_data.7z: Monitored data.
- main.py and monitor.py: Scripts used to perform the experiments.
- demo_cli_#.py are the files for each of the defects inject, according to the name presented in the dissertation.
- demo_cli_CONTROL.py is the original file, considered without defects.

OBS: This project uses many files, so some defects required files in encoder directory to be modified too. These files are named accordingly.
