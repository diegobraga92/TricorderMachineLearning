# BERT

Files:

- bert_data.7z: Monitored data
- main.py and monitor.py: Scripts used to perform the experiments.
- run_classifier_# and run_squad_# are the files for each of the defects inject, according to the name presented in the dissertation.
- run_classifier_CONTROL and run_squad_CONTROL are the original files, considered without defects.

OBS: For this project only two files were used to inject defects, run_classifier and run_squad. That is because each file was executed depending on the workload used as input.
